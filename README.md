The code in this repository is the logic for a graph, queue, and linked list. Eventually my goal is to have the graph include a method that returns the shortest path between any two points on the graph. The code currently contains much of the logic that would be used in this method. Including reversing a linked list, creating a graph, adding vertices and edges, and much more. I have included unit tests to go along with the logic. It is my hope that this will give you a sense of my coding style.

I am in the process of learning Python and still working out how to connect the different files when they are in different folders. For this reason they are all in the same file. I am proud of myself for everything I have learned in 2 days.

To run the test files (or any of the files), type the following into the cloned directory of the project

python filename.py
