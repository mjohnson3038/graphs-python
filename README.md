The code in this repository is the logic for a graph, queue, and linked list. Eventually my goal is to have the graph include a method that returns the shortest path between any two points on the graph. I have included unit tests to go along with the logic. It is my hope that this will give you a sense of my coding style.

I am in the process of learning Python and still working out how to connect the different files when they are in different folders. For this reason they are all in the same file.
